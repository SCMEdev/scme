# To use SCME in QUIP: 
# Move this ThirdParty/ into QUIP/src/ and then scme/ into ThirdParty/ to get
#   QUIP/src/ThirdParty/scme/

# export_activate.sh:
# -Change the environmental varibles to suite your system 
# -Change "quippy2" to the name of the conda env where you want to (re)install quippy. 
# put export_activate.sh in QUIP/

# To install quippy with scme: 
# from QUIP/ : 	
. export_activate.sh 
[make config #make choices, only needed once to create Make.inc]
make install-quippy


# IPModel_SCME.f95 should be put into QUIP/src/Potenitals/, substituting the present one.
